# ANIME.js [<img src="http://benschwarz.github.io/bower-badges/badge@2x.png" width="130" height="30">](#bower)
Reveal CSS animation as you scroll down a page.
By default, you can use it to trigger [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) animations.
But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:
- Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup
- Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it
- You can change the settings (duration, delay)
